== WebRap ==
A webinterface for controlling your gcode based 3d printer.
I started this project to transform my reprap printer to a wireless printer, by using a raspberry pi with a wifi dongle, that runs this webinterface.

== Features ==
- movement control
- temperature control
- extrusion control
- "console" interface for both, native gcode commands plus little webrap specific simplifications (e.g. move x10)

== Warning ==
This tool is in an early stage. So at the moment the target audience is a the more experienced reprap users not at beginners.
Use at your own risk ;-).
