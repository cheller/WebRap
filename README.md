WebRap
======
A webinterface for controlling your gcode based 3d printer.
I started this project to transform my reprap into a wireless 3d printer by using a raspberry pi (with wifi dongle), that runs this webinterface.

Features
--------
- movement control
- temperature control
- extrusion control
- "console" interface for both, native gcode commands plus little webrap specific simplifications (e.g. move x10)
- upload & printcontrol of .gcode files (workflow: slice at your pc, print via webinterface)

Warning
-------
This tool is in an early stage. So at the moment the target audience is a the more experienced reprap users not at beginners.
Use at your own risk ;-).
